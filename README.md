## Alternative
The application also has been fully deployed at https://fabtierlist.netlify.app
- Since I am using a free backend service the app can go idle so please wait at least a minute for the data to return

## Future
- creating a landing page with the nerd info and documentation on what the site is used for
- updating how the tiers work in regards to the heroes win rate
- Allow users to click a hero to view its specific matchups and see its tier ranking.
